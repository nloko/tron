This is my entry for the 2010 Google AI Challenge

It is, to be honest, a complete mess of hacky, quick, dirty code.
It was, however, good enough for 49th place out of approximately
800 submissions.

Quick Strategy Summary
======================

- determine if enemy is attainable
- if so, perform alphabeta at as many plies as possible within the 1 
   second time limit (typically between 7-12)
- at terminal nodes or endgame states, evaulate the number of reachable
   squares for each player and return a score (my reachable area - opponent
   reachable area)
- if enemy not attainable, fill remaining space as efficiently as possible
   (flood fill)
